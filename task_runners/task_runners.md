# Task runners

## General

Task runners are tools that will let you create commands for common tasks like copying files, running tests, removing old files or start the server.

It is very common that a big project has a task-runner or at the very least uses [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) to run tasks.

The following task runners are at the time of writing this document the most common:

* [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)
* [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/)
